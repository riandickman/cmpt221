Introduction
============
The cmpt 221 repository is collection of labs in Marist College's Software Development II class. 
In this class, students learn how to develop their own application, as described to them by an outside client. 
Each lab builds on the previous one to guide students to how to create both a front-end and back-end for their application for it to be fully functional.
